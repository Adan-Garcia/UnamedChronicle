«You fight like you're already broken. Let me help.» *Ancient gears clatter deep within the ruined city.* <<Maybe this is what happiness feels like.>> <<If I fall here, at least I fall reaching upward.>>
«The world can burn. I'd still find you.» <<I should say something, but words tangle in my throat.>> *Velvet curtains sway as the storm rages outside.* «Is it wrong that I never want this night to end?»

«No more running. No more hiding.» <<Loneliness wears many masks.>> *Lantern light casts long shadows along the dusty road.*
«Maybe... maybe we could build something here.» <<No map could have prepared me for this.>> «Laugh if you want. I'm still standing.»
«You're not alone. Not anymore.»
*The fireplace crackles as I sink into the old chair.* «Stay behind me. This time, I won't fail.» <<The weight of my promises anchors my steps.>> «Don't let go. No matter what you hear.» <<Maybe survival isn't enough anymore.>>

«For every star that falls, I'll make a wish for us.» «For every star that falls, I'll make a wish for us.» <<It's terrifying how much I want to stay.>> *The café smells of fresh pastries and burnt coffee.* *The glass dome overhead fractures with a sharp snap.*
«No more running. No more hiding.» *The gentle tug of their hand pulls me closer.* <<Not all storms are weather.>> *Their laugh echoes against the stone walls.* «The world can burn. I'd still find you.»
<<The world fades around us and I don't even mind.>> «Stay behind me. This time, I won't fail.»
<<Maybe this is what happiness feels like.>> «Promise me we'll see the sunrise together.» *Mist rolls across the abandoned battlefield.*
<<Bravery isn't fighting dragons — it's reaching out first.>> *Rain pelts down on the rooftop as I race for cover.* «Laugh if you want. I'm still standing.» <<Memories bloom where scars once lived.>>
<<Memories bloom where scars once lived.>> *The gentle tug of their hand pulls me closer.* «Maybe... maybe we could build something here.» *Ancient gears clatter deep within the ruined city.* <<Home isn't a place — it's the people who wait.>> «Hold tight. I won't let anything happen to you.»
«Even if the sky falls, I'll still find you.» <<I should say something, but words tangle in my throat.>> «Come on. Race you to the edge of the world!»
*The fireplace crackles as I sink into the old chair.* «Hold tight. I won't let anything happen to you.»
«Trust me. We won't fall.» «Don't let go. No matter what you hear.» *The café smells of fresh pastries and burnt coffee.* *Wind carries the scent of salt and far-off places.*
*The garden hums with bees and sunlight.* «Stay behind me. This time, I won't fail.» <<The world fades around us and I don't even mind.>> <<Home isn't a place — it's the people who wait.>>
«Laugh if you want. I'm still standing.» <<Hope and fear taste the same tonight.>> *The stars shimmer above as I step onto the balcony.*
*Blades clash under the blood-red sunset.* <<Sometimes the smallest steps change the most.>> <<Sometimes the hardest battles are the ones inside.>>
<<Is it still courage if I'm trembling?>> «Laugh if you want. I'm still standing.» «You always know how to find trouble.» *A low hum fills the neon-lit street.*
<<It's terrifying how much I want to stay.>> «You don't have to say anything. I already know.» «The stars are jealous of how you shine.» <<Home isn't a place — it's the people who wait.>>
<<No map could have prepared me for this.>> *Ancient gears clatter deep within the ruined city.*
*I brush a lock of hair from my face, heart racing.* <<Memories bloom where scars once lived.>> «Trust me. We won't fall.» «The stars are jealous of how you shine.» *The gentle tug of their hand pulls me closer.* <<The world fades around us and I don't even mind.>>
<<No map could have prepared me for this.>> *The air smells of rain and gunpowder.* <<How did a moment this simple become everything?>> *Steam fogs up the windows as we talk late into the night.*
«Tell me there's another way.» «Don't let go. No matter what you hear.» *Their laugh echoes against the stone walls.* <<Sometimes the smallest steps change the most.>>
<<Sometimes the smallest steps change the most.>> *The campfire crackles as laughter spills into the night.* «I never wanted a crown. Only freedom.»
«Tell me again why we thought this was a good idea?» *Their laugh echoes against the stone walls.* <<Danger lurks behind every shadow, but so does wonder.>> <<Their smile wrecks every wall I've built.>>
*The gentle tug of their hand pulls me closer.* «Maybe... maybe we could build something here.» *Velvet curtains sway as the storm rages outside.* <<The weight of my promises anchors my steps.>>
