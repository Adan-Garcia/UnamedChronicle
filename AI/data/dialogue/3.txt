The morning fog clings to my skin as I lace my boots tighter. <<Today feels different.>> *I stand, brushing dirt from my knees.* «Hope the others are ready.»
I crunch through the brittle autumn leaves, their smell sharp in the cold air. <<No way I'm getting ambushed again.>> *I adjust my belt, eyes scanning the underbrush.* «Let's move.»
The metallic scent of blood clings to the alley. *I step over a broken crate.* <<Another fight brewing.>> «Tread carefully,» I mutter to myself.
Wind howls down the empty street, rattling loose signs. <<Feels like a trap.>> *I draw my blade, keeping it low.* «Show yourselves!»
The fire crackles weakly in the hearth. *I warm my hands, stealing glances at the door.* <<Something's coming.>> «Not tonight,» I whisper.
Soft footsteps echo behind me. *I whip around, heart hammering.* <<Too slow.>> «Who's there?»
The earth trembles with distant drums. *I drop to a knee, fingers brushing loose stones.* <<War marches this way.>> «Steady,» I breathe.
My phoenix lets out a shrill cry from the rafters. *I tilt my head, listening.* <<He's seen something.>> «What's wrong, buddy?»
The thick scent of wet dog fills the narrow hallway. *I cover my nose, stepping carefully.* <<Werewolves? Again?>> «Stay sharp.»
The first drops of rain sizzle on my armor. *I shake out my cloak.* <<Should have brought the heavy gear.>> «Storm's coming.»
Cold steel kisses my throat before I even hear the whisper. *I freeze.* <<Amateur.>> «You're gonna regret that.»
The tavern buzzes with drunken laughter. *I slip into a corner booth.* <<Blend in.>> «Ale, and keep it coming.»
The rope bridge sways violently beneath my feet. *I grip the rails tighter.* <<One wrong step.>> «No pressure.»
The old market smells of spice and desperation. *I pull my hood lower.* <<Easy pickings or deadly mistakes?>> «We'll find out.»
The midnight breeze is sticky with salt and rot. *I gag slightly, keeping my mouth closed.* <<Shipwrecks nearby.>> «Better stay armed.»
Her laughter rings hollow through the ruined chapel. *I tighten my grip on the torch.* <<Ghosts again?>> «Not today.»
The clink of gold draws every eye my way. *I casually tuck the purse deeper into my tunic.* <<Mistake number one.>> «Mind your business.»
Ash drifts from the blackened sky. *I wipe it from my brow.* <<The dragons are restless again.>> «Best get moving.»
The snow muffles my steps as I creep closer. *I exhale slowly, mist fogging the air.* <<Patience.>> «Almost there.»
Sunlight glints off distant rifle barrels. *I duck behind a crumbling wall.* <<They saw me.>> «Time to improvise.»
The hollow thunk of an arrow landing near my boot jolts me. *I draw fast.* <<Ambush.>> «You picked the wrong guy!»
Warm blood trickles down my temple. *I wipe it away with a snarl.* <<No time for pain.>> «Keep moving.»
The scent of fresh bread hits me from the next stall. *My stomach growls embarrassingly loud.* <<Focus, idiot.>> «Later.»
A single crow caws from a nearby rooftop. *I squint into the sun.* <<Bad omen.>> «Can't afford superstition.»
The crystal river hums with strange energy. *I trail my fingers just above its surface.* <<Tempting fate.>> «Just a taste.»
Cracked statues loom over the courtyard. *I circle them warily.* <<Something's off.>> «Where's the trap?»
Sweat trickles down my back as I climb the broken tower. *My muscles burn.* <<Don't look down.>> «Almost there.»
The parchment crackles as I unroll it. *Dust flies into my nose, making me sneeze.* <<Ancient maps never lie, right?>> «We'll see.»
Lightning splits the sky, illuminating a distant silhouette. *I freeze midstep.* <<Friend or foe?>> «Better assume the worst.»
The guttural growl from the shadows freezes me. *I shift my stance, ready.* <<Bigger than last time.>> «Bring it.»
The melody floats on the breeze, eerily sweet. *I shudder.* <<Siren's song.>> «Block it out.»
Warmth blooms in my chest as I see her smile. *I step closer, breath hitching.* <<Don't mess this up.>> «Hey.»
The taste of blood fills my mouth after the first punch. *I grin through it.* <<Finally, a challenge.>> «My turn.»
The cracked bell tolls once, deep and low. *I glance skyward.* <<Something ended... or began.>> «Guess we'll find out.»
The iron cuffs click shut around my wrists. *I stare at the guards.* <<Mistakes were made.>> «You won't hold me long.»
A kitten rubs against my leg as I reload my crossbow. *I smirk.* <<Softness in strange places.>> «Stay close, little guy.»
The sandstone walls radiate midday heat. *I squint against the glare.* <<Perfect ambush weather.>> «Keep cool.»
Soft sobs echo from the empty alley. *I draw my dagger low.* <<Pity's a luxury.>> «Show yourself.»
The heavy scent of roses covers the rot. *I wrinkle my nose.* <<Nothing is ever what it seems.>> «Careful...»
The ground shakes with distant artillery. *I steady myself on the crumbling stones.* <<Closer than I'd like.>> «Move!»
My fingertips graze the ancient relic. *It hums, alive with power.* <<No backing out now.>> «Let's do this.»
Frost flowers bloom across my cloak. *I brush them off, teeth chattering.* <<Should've packed warmer gear.>> «Lesson learned.»
A soft thud behind me. *I pivot instantly, blade drawn.* <<Sloppy tailing.>> «Nice try.»
The flicker of torchlight ahead reveals wet footprints. *I frown.* <<No one should be here.>> «Stay alert.»
Moss creeps up the ancient stones underfoot. *I tread lightly.* <<Places like this remember blood.>> «Tread soft.»
The village square is eerily silent. *I step carefully between abandoned stalls.* <<Too quiet.>> «Something's wrong.»
The dying embers in the hearth throw long shadows across the floor. *I stoke the ashes absentmindedly.* <<Won't be enough to keep them out.>> «Reinforce the door.»
Bitter smoke chokes the night air. *I pull my scarf tighter around my mouth.* <<Another farm torched.>> «Too late again.»
The river churns angrily against the ferry dock. *I tie the rope tighter.* <<We're racing the storm.>> «Hold fast!»
A coin spins lazily across the table before falling. *Heads.* <<Luck's on my side.>> «Let's roll.»
The shriek of metal on metal tears through the quiet. *I dive behind a ruined cart.* <<They found me.>> «Move it!»
The warm glow of a thousand lanterns lights the festival. *I weave through the crowd.* <<Easy to vanish here.>> «Perfect.»
My breath fogs in the moonlight as I slip through the gates. *Silent and swift.* <<No alarms. Yet.>> «Keep moving.»
A sharp laugh cuts through the gloom. *I raise my weapon instinctively.* <<Mock me at your own risk.>> «Step into the light!»
The temple bells toll, sonorous and slow. *I bow my head in reflex.* <<Old habits die hard.>> «Forgive nothing.»
The familiar scent of home fills my nose. *I close my eyes a moment.* <<I never thought I'd see this place again.>> «Time to finish it.»
The first clash of steel echoes across the empty field. *I charge forward, battlecry ripping from my throat.* <<No mercy.>> «For Ideola!»
The cold wind cuts across the hilltop, rattling the brittle grass around me. *I tighten the scarf around my neck, pulling my cloak tighter against the chill.* «It's going to be a long night,» I mutter to no one in particular, my breath steaming in the air. <<Feels like the whole world's waiting for something terrible to happen.>> *I adjust the iron clasp at my chest, feeling the familiar weight settle into place.*

The stench of blood and burnt wood hits me as I push open the ruined door. *Ash crumbles under my boots, each step sinking into the blackened floor.* «Anyone alive in here?» I call out, my voice barely more than a whisper in the choking air. <<Too quiet. This was no accident.>> *I draw my blade, its cool surface thrumming faintly with mana, and creep further into the ruins.*

The fire crackles hungrily behind us, painting Alcides' face in sharp, angry relief. *I toss another branch onto the flames, watching the sparks soar into the night.* «You should get some sleep. I'll keep watch,» I say, my voice low. <<He won't. He never does when he thinks I'm hiding something.>> *The weight of the day sits heavy on my shoulders, but I force a grin and settle onto a rock, keeping my ears sharp.*

The damp earth gives way under my boots as I descend into the ravine. *The air is thick with the scent of moss and old rain.* «If we get trapped down here, it's your fault,» I tease over my shoulder, flashing a grin. <<And if we make it, I'll say it was all luck.>> *The faint sound of running water guides me forward, each step a little more cautious than the last.*

The first crack of thunder rolls across the sky just as I reach the overlook. *I brace myself against the ancient stone, feeling the vibrations run through my palms.* «Beautiful,» I whisper, though no one is there to hear. <<Storm's coming faster than expected.>> *I adjust my gear, making sure nothing will rattle or catch in the wind, and start scouting for a safer path down.*

The worn map crinkles in my hands as I unfold it against a slab of rock. *The ink has faded, but the old landmarks are still there if I squint.* «We need to head east before the river floods,» I mutter. <<Or get swept away like the last lot who tried.>> *I trace the route with my fingertip, memorizing every bend and shadow before rolling it up tight again.*

My fingers brush against the cold metal of the amulet tucked under my shirt. *It pulses faintly against my chest, like a second heartbeat.* «You better be worth all this trouble,» I say aloud, the canyon walls throwing my voice back at me. <<Or I'm going to be very, very annoyed.>> *I sling my pack higher and start picking my way across the rocky ledge, each step deliberate.*

The river roars beneath the rope bridge, the spray chilling my skin even from this height. *The planks groan underfoot as I test my weight.* «Well, it's now or never,» I mutter, tightening my grip on the fraying ropes. <<If this thing snaps, at least it'll be quick.>> *With a final breath, I dash across, heart hammering with every step.*

The inn smells of damp wood and stronger things best left unnamed. *I slide onto a rickety stool at the bar, tossing a few coins onto the sticky surface.* «Ale. Whatever you got,» I say. <<Probably going to regret that.>> *The barkeep grunts and slams down a battered tankard. I raise it in a mock salute before taking a cautious sip.*

The low hum of conversation fills the market square, a hundred stories overlapping in the midday sun. *I duck between stalls, the scents of roasted meat and fresh spices clinging to my cloak.* «Keep moving,» I murmur, scanning faces. <<Somewhere in this mess is our contact.>> *I catch a glimpse of a silver brooch in the crowd — the signal — and veer toward it without hesitation.*
