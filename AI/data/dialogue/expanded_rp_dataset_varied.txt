*Footsteps echo in the deserted subway station. The lake's surface shimmers under the first light of dawn.* <<If fear has a voice, it is whispering now.>> «Stay. Not because you have to — because you want to.»

*A sharp gust carries laughter across the neon-lit street. The lake's surface shimmers under the first light of dawn.* <<Laughter feels strange after so many battles.>> «I would face a thousand storms if you stood beside me.»
*A sharp gust carries laughter across the neon-lit street.* <<I would cross galaxies just to hear them laugh again.>> «Legends spoke of this sword. Today, it is ours. Stay with me. We'll face whatever comes together.»
*Their laugh is a melody I never knew I needed.* <<Nothing gold can stay... but I will fight to keep it.>> «Hold my hand. Just... don't let go, okay? Legends spoke of this sword. Today, it is ours.»
*We dance slowly under the falling cherry blossoms.* <<I never believed in fate until now.>> «Stay with me. We'll face whatever comes together.»
