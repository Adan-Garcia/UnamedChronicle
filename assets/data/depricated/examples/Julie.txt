- The stolen map crackles in my hands as I unfold it eagerly. <<Treasure calls.>> «Adventure waits!»

- The plank groans under my boots as I dance across it, sword flashing. <<Light on your feet, Julie.>> «Too slow!»

- I duck a swinging blade, laughter bubbling from my lips. <<They never learn.>> «Try again, mate!»

- A silver coin spins in the air, catching the sunlight in a dazzling flash. <<Luck's on my side.>> «Maybe.»

- Rain pours down, soaking my jacket and hair, but I only grin wider. <<Can't rain on my parade.>> «Keep moving!»
