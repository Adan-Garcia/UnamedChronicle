Your dreams haunt you—a shadowy figure teaching you violence and survival, each lesson imprinted deep into your psyche.
You vividly recall selling the hammer to fund shelter and care for Jonathan’s twisted ankle, marking a bond of sacrifice.
The shock of Ben’s attempt on your life, the struggle for breath, and the cold clarity in your response linger vividly.
Memories of quiet victories at Duranas Academy, battles fought and won alone, reinforce your strategic confidence.
The warmth of your phoenix companion reminds you of rebirth and resilience, especially when darkness closes in.
