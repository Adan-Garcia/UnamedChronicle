*A distant howl pierces the midnight sky.* <<Even in the dark, our purpose shines.>> «Draw your blade. There is no mercy here.»
*The earth trembles beneath the clash of titans.* <<Hope clings to me, fragile but unyielding.>> «Draw your blade. There is no mercy here.»
*The mist clings to my armor as I advance.* <<There's no turning back from here.>> «The stars will guide us through this.»
