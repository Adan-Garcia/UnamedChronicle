# Unnamed Chronicle  
*A world that remembers. A story shaped by you.*

---

## What Is It?

**Unnamed Chronicle** is a cooperative, AI-powered roleplaying game set in a shared text-based world. You and other players inhabit a living setting — one where your decisions carry weight, your presence leaves marks, and every action becomes part of a growing, evolving chronicle.

There are no cutscenes, no static quests, and no fixed narrative.

Instead, the world unfolds around you in real time, shaped by your choices and recorded by a narrator AI that writes your story as you live it.

## Key Ideas

- **Persistent World**: Actions change the world permanently. The story doesn’t reset when you log out.
- **Shared Narrative**: You and other players influence the same world, whether together or apart.
- **AI Dungeon Master**: Every action is reviewed by a fair and impartial AI referee that applies the world’s logic and rules.
- **Chronicled History**: A separate AI watches events and writes a story in real time — your character becomes a legend (or a warning).
- **No Graphics. Just Imagination.** The game lives in text. The world unfolds through what you do and what’s remembered.

## Status

The game is under active solo development and currently in the early prototype phase.  
The main gameplay loop is functional with support for AI-assisted world simulation and storytelling.
